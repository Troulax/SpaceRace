# Space Race - Java 2D Game

Space Race is a 2D computer game developed in Java where players control a spaceship running out of fuel, navigating through space to collect fuel resources while avoiding meteors and other celestial obstacles.

## Gameplay

- **Objective**: The main objective of the game is to collect as much fuel as possible to keep the spaceship running and avoid collisions with obstacles.
- **Controls**: Players can control the spaceship using keyboard inputs (arrow keys or WASD) to maneuver through space.
- **Fuel Collection**: Fuel resources are scattered throughout the game environment, and players must navigate their spaceship to collect them.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Players must avoid collisions with meteors, other celestial objects, and walls, as crashing into them will result in damage to the spaceship or score penalties.
- **Scoring**: Players earn points for each fuel resource collected. However, colliding with obstacles or walls results in a score penalty. If the score drops below 0, the player loses the game.
  
    - Colliding with obstacles: -1 score penalty
    - Colliding with walls: -1 score penalty
    - Falling below 0 score: Game Over
